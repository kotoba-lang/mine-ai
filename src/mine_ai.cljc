  "KAMI Mine AI — AI-side heuristics for mining operations: deterministic,
  explainable helpers for extraction risk scoring and next-period
  extraction planning. Restored from the legacy kami-engine/kami-mine-ai
  Rust crate (deleted in kotoba-lang/kami-engine PR #82 'Remove Rust
  workspace from kami-engine') as part of the clj-wgsl migration
  (ADR-2607010930, com-junkawasaki/root).

  Zero-dep portable CLJC — pure data + pure functions, no IO/GPU. A
  single flat namespace (the original was one flat `lib.rs`). Depends on
  kotoba-lang/mine-pds for `mine`/`mine-status`/`extraction-record` data
  shapes (duck-typed here, not a hard code dependency — matching the
  pattern used for kotoba-lang/brep's sketch-constraint-kind vocabulary)."
